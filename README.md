# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
Speech emotion detection is a process of recognizing the emotion of humans and the affective state of humans by 
speech. The main python library which will be used for this project is lybrosa for analysing audio and music. 
The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song dataset (RAVDESS) is used for model training. The main goal of this project 
is to work with audio files and to identify how different voice and pitch of human works and how we can recognize what the person is feeling by just analysing
speech. Experiments planning to run include importing the required libraries, loading the dataset, exploratory data analysis of audio data, 
cleaning the dataset (noise removal), feature extraction, splitting of data, model building, and prediction.
